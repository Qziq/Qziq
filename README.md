|| Greetings fellow humans,

I have my Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering and have been working as a civil engineer. As time went by I couldn't stop myself from going back to school. Computer science just kept fascinating me and it consumed all my spare time.

This is why recently started studying Technical Computer Science (Bachelor) at the University of Twente. I'm a first-year Technical Computer Science (Bachelor) student at the University of Twente. I'm currently studying networking systems.

I know the programming languages Java, Python and JavaScript. I also know how to use HTML and CSS for web development.
