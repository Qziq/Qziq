|| Greetings fellow humans,

I'm a first-year Technical Computer Science (Bachelor) student at the University of Twente in my early 30's. 

I have my Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering and have been working as a civil engineer. As time went by I couldn't stop myself from going back to school. Computer science just kept fascinating me and it consumed all my spare time. 

I recently started studying Technical Computer Science (Bachelor) at the University of Twente.

I know the basics of the programming languages Python and JavaScript. I also know the basics of HTML and CSS for web development.
During my Technical Computer Science studies the first new programming language I learn is Java.
